        <p id="summary">
          Traditionally, progress does not occur in a vacuum. In order for any necessary change to materialize, it is contingent on the communal efforts of those emotionally invested in a cause. The same notion is applicable to human development. As
          we navigate through our experience, we are constantly met with stimuli that contribute to the manner in which we perceive ourselves and our surroundings. Our self-perception dictates our trajectory and the trajectory of others we meet along
          our path. In conjunction with being a time for students to explore the intricacies of their academic interest, college is also a period where young adults are offered an opportunity to discover themselves in ways unachievable within the
          confines of their home. Considering that many people encounter difficulties when charting unfamiliar territories, it is imperative to cultivate a relationship with those who have endured similar experiences as means to mitigate further
          complications and to use as guard rail towards the path of self-discovery. MentorMatch facilitates this process through providing students with a list of potential mentors, based on the questionnaire results, and with the autonomy of
          choosing after an initial electronic meeting. More information regarding the process can be found in the matching section.

          <p>I believe, in order to create as the to focus the following two processes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Matching</li>
            <li>Sustaining Connection</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Establishing an effective matching methodology will set the tone for a student’s experience. Therefore, I deem it imperative to consider multiple factors when suggesting a potential pairing with a student. See next section for more
            details.
          </p>
          <p>Sustaining a connection is just as important as ensuring a compatible pairing is established. In order to do so I implementing I have identified various features that will increase organization between both parties thus echancing
            connection.

      <ul>
        <li> Both parties fill out questionnaire to build out profile</li>
        <li>Once completed, a list of potential matches will sent to both mentors and mentees based on responses
        <li>Users can view each respective person’s profile before proceeding</li>
        </li>
        <li>From there, either party can request to video chat</li>
        <li>After the meeting, a prompt will be presented asking if they would like to confirm
          <ul>
            <li>if not - return to list of potential matches</li>
            <li>if so - presented with Portal and wait until they confirm (See Sustaining Connection)</li>
