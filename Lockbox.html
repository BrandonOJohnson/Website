        <h2 id = "about"> About Project </h2>
        <p id = "summary">Our product, LockBox, safely stores your packages and
          allows owners to monitor their packages via a mobile
          application. In this report, we examine how our users
          interacted with LockBox. The two channels that we
          tested for are the mobile app and the screen on the
          LockBox itself.
          We conducted four user tests in total; Three for the first
          iteration and one after we did some minor tweaks. Users
          were asked to complete four tasks in total: the first several
          tasks tested our mobile prototype, and the last task tested
          the navigation and flow of the display of the LockBox itself.
          Our users found the task of interacting with the
          LockBox to unlock it using a passcode, the most
          challenging task. In hindsight, our design had a flaw that
          did not allow the user to go to the next step smoothly.
          The users completed the other three tasks of unlocking
          the device, viewing the camera and checking the history
          efficiently during our tests.
          Based on our observations from our user testing, we
          were able to improve our task performance by replacing
          the icon on the LockBox screen with a much more
          straightforward button that was recognizable to the users.</p>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>Companies such as, Amazon Lockers,
          iDoorBox, BenchBox, have contributed to the
          efforts of mitigating this issue; however, their
          approach often neglect abilities that will render
          the user’s experience more secure about the
          safety of their package. For example, Box Lock
          offers a mobile application and allows users
          to track their items; however, it lacks to ability
          for users to view their packages and doesn’t
          include the provision of a box.</p>

      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>

      <p>We conducted four user studies in total to test our prototypes. Three users tested our first iteration of LockBox and then the last user tested our updated prototype. Our participants ranged in age from 18 to 36, with a median age of 23.5.
        There were two males and two females who tested our prototypes. We screened the user by asking them. How old are you? (If under 18, terminate study) all participants verbally consented to our testing protocol and agreed to be recorded for
        learning purposes.</p>

      <p><b>We had a total of four main tasks.</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>How would you go about generating a passcode to share with your friend?</li>
        <li>Can you use the Lockbox app to view the camera on the Lockbox to see if the construction crew is gone for the day?</li>
        <li>Can you go through the app and look through your history to see when the diapers were delivered?</li>
        <li>Could you please show me how you would use the screen on the Lockbox to unlock the box and receive your package?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="Learnings" id="learnings">
      <h2>What We Learned</h2>
      <p> After doing multiple user tests, we analyzed the feedback shared by users to make the interface more user-friendly. There were some labels and navigational items; the user felt challenging to proceed. We considered that and discussed how
        navigation could be made more accessible. Many users liked the feature view camera; it gives them the freedom to access their lockbox from any location. Some of the users noted the difficulty in performing two particular tasks; how to enter a
        passcode and how to unlock the lockbox. Features like view history help the user to keep a record of when an item was last ordered. Our users also liked the idea if the primary user is not available to access the lockbox, an option like share
        passcode by primary user gives the flexibility and security that the authorized person can only access LockBox.</p>

      <div class="Feedback" id="feedback">
        <br>
        <p><b>Listed below are the changes and feedback given by the users.</b></p>
        <li>Changing the icon on the device screen to a key.</li>
        <li>Suggested sending notifications to the owner each time the LockBox
          is unlocked.</li>
        <li>Found the unlock option a little confusing and suggested it be renamed.</li>
        <li>Suggested changing the directory hierarchy for the password share feature.</li>
